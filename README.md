# Dots_and_Boxes

Python is not my main language so i didnt know how to get inputs from user each turn and i didnt have time to search so i think the algorithem is correct but the program isnt working correctly, it needs inputs.

## main.py :
Algorithem that gets the number of players and then dimentions of our playground
its not completed yet, we cant give values and actually play but pointing system and general algorithem works

## game.py
fixed dimention and a 1 vs 1 game of dots and boxes with pygame library
